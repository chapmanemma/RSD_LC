/*This code takes real space simulation boxes and produces a light cone, simultaneously taking into account the peculiar velocities of the hydrogen atoms. The code interpolates between two redshift boxes in order to account for the evolution between discretised redshift boxes.

 This code was written by Emma Chapman, Imperial College London. Please contact e.chapman@imperial.ac.uk with any comments or questions.
 Please cite the accompanying paper () when publishing work which uses this code.
 
 USAGE:
 The code is compiled using the makefile provided with the standard simfast package, by adding a line such as:
 RSD_LC: $(aux) RSD_LC_v2.0.o
	mpicc -o RSD_LC RSD_LC_v2.0.o $(aux) $(flags) -L/path/to/mpi/lib -I/path/to/mpi/include 
 
 ./RSD_LC workdir nu1 nu2 del_nu_lc FoV_deg [LC_Dim] [z1] [z2]
 workdir: Working directory containing box folders. Lightcone will be output here in folder "Lightcone"
 nu1: Frequency of first map in light cone (MHz)
 nu2: Frequency of last map in light cone (MHz)
 del_nu_lc: Frequency separation between light cone slices
 FoV_deg: Field of view of light cone in degrees
 LC_Dim: Number of pixels along side of light cone map (if not specificied assumed same as input box dimension)
 z1: The lowest redshift box to include
 z2: The highest redshift box to include
 
 INPUT BOXES:
 The box formats are expected to be in the same format as output by SimFast21, i.e. binary files with c ordering.
 * = only if TS included in T21 calculation
 () = name of box as output by simfast21

 ionization (xHII)
 non-linear density field (deltanl)
 IGM temperature (TempX)*
 collisional coupling (xc)*
 Lyman-alpha coupling (xalpha)*
 velocity field (vel)
 
 OUTPUT:
 A 3D fits file of brightness temperature in units of K with constant field of view accross a chosen frequency range.
